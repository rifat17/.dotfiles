# Ln Command in Linux (Create Symbolic Links)

A symbolic link, also known as a symlink or soft link, is a special type of file that points to another file or directory.

In this guide, we will cover how to use the ln command to create symbolic links.


# Links Types

There are two types of links in Linux/UNIX systems:

- **Hard links**. You can think a hard link as an additional name for an existing file. Hard links are associating two or more file names with the same inode . You can create one or more hard links for a single file. Hard links cannot be created for directories and files on a different filesystem or partition.
- **Soft links**. A soft link is something like a shortcut in Windows. It is an indirect pointer to a file or directory. Unlike a hard link, a symbolic link can point to a file or a directory on a different filesystem or partition.


# How to Use the `ln` Command

`ln` is a command-line utility for creating links between files. By default, the `ln` command creates hard links. To create a symbolic link, use the `-s` (`--symbolic`) option.

The `ln` command syntax for creating symbolic links is as follows:

	ln -s [OPTIONS] FILE LINK

- If both the `FILE` and `LINK` are given, `ln` will create a link from the file specified as the first argument (`FILE`) to the file specified as the second argument (`LINK`).
- If only one file is given as an argument or the second argument is a dot (`.`), ln will create a link to that file in the current working directory . The name of the symlink will be the same as the name of the file it points to.

By default, on success, `ln` doesnâ€™t produce any output and returns zero.


# Creating Symlink To a File

To create a symbolic link to a given file, open your terminal and type:

	ln -s source_file symbolic_link

Replace `source_file` with the name of the existing file for which you want to create the symbolic link and `symbolic_link` with the name of the symbolic link.


The `symbolic_link` parameter is optional. If you do not specify the symbolic link, the `ln` command will create a new link in your current directory:

In the following example, we are creating a symbolic link named `my_link.txt` to a file named `my_file.txt`:


	$ ln -s my_file.txt my_link.txt


To verify that the symlink was successfully created, use the `ls` command:

	$ ls -l my_link.txt

The output will look something like this:

	lrwxrwxrwx 1 linuxize users  4 Nov  2 23:03  my_link.txt -> my_file.txt

The l character is a file type flag that represents a symbolic link. The `->` symbol shows the file the symlink points to.

# Creating Symlinks To a Directory 


The command for creating a symbolic link to a directory is the same as when creating a symbolic link to a file. Specify the directory name as the first parameter and the symlink as the second parameter.

For example, if you want to create a symbolic link from the `/mnt/my_drive/movies` directory to the `~/my_movies` directory you would run:

	ln -s /mnt/my_drive/movies ~/my_movies


# Overwriting Symlinks

If you try to create a symbolic link that already exists , the `ln` command will print an error message.

	$ ln -s my_file.txt my_link.txt
	ln: failed to create symbolic link 'my_link.txt': File exists


To overwrite the destination path of the symlink, use the `-f` (`--force`) option.

	$ ln -sf my_file.txt my_link.txt


# Removing Symlinks

To delete/remove symbolic links use either the `unlink` or `rm` command.

The syntax of the `unlink` is very simple:

	unlink symlink_to_remove

Removing a symbolic link using the `rm` command is the same as when removing a file:


	rm symlink_to_remove

No matter which command you use, when removing a symbolic link not append the `/` trailing slash at the end of its name.

If you delete or move the source file to a different location, the symbolic file will be left dangling (broken) and should be removed.


# Conclusion

To create a symbolic link is Linux use the `ln` command with the `-s` option.

For more information about the `ln` command, visit the `ln man` page or type `man ln` in your terminal.
